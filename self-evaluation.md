#Self-Evaluation
- How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far? I am feeling confident in my basic knowledge of what arrays are and how to manipulate them with basic methods.
- I have bookmarked the Ruby arrays page and will do some self studying to learn more array methods.
- Is there a maximum number of elements that can be placed into an array?
